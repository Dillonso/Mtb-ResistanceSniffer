# Mtb-ResistanceSniffer
An online tool for the prediction of drug resistance in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis using Next Generation Sequencing Data.

The program was initially written in python 2.7.
Multiple input files can be uploaded as either complete genomes in Genbank format (*.gb; *.gbk; *.gbf; *.gbff), read contigs or fragmented genome sequences in FASTA (*.fasta; *.fas; *.fna; *.fst; *.fa)
sequences of predicted genes or proteins in FASTA (*.fnn and *.faa, respectively),uncompressed variant call format files (*.vcf).

After successful running, the output will be available in the output folder in both plain text and svg format.
